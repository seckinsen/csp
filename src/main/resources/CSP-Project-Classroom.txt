You are tasked to schedule computer science courses that meets on Mondays.

Below are the 5 courses that meet and 3 classrooms to teach these courses.
You are constrained by the fact that each classroom can only host one course at a time.

The courses are:
• Class 1 - Intro to Programming: meets from 8:00-9:00am
• Class 2 - Intro to Artificial Intelligence: meets from 8:30-9:30am
• Class 3 - Image Processing: meets from 9:00-10:00am
• Class 4 - Databases: meets from 9:00-10:00am
• Class 5 - Computer Organization: meets from 9:30-10:30am

Due to the number of students that are enrolled and the classroom size:
• A01, available to teach Classes 3 and 4.
• B01, available to teach Classes 2, 3, 4, and 5.
• C01, available to teach Classes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Considering these constraints and the problem described please implement a generic CSP algorithm to solve the problem.
